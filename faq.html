        <p>Because I have a lifelong love for creating things.<br><br>  
        When I was a child, I used to write short stories, create my own board games, and build communities with Legos. As I grew up, I listened to songs and imagine stories within them that could be told with video clips of popular movies and TV shows.  I felt compelled to tell my stories so I became a video editor.  My work expanded and includes videos currently used for training by the US Department of Homeland Security.  <br><br>Presently, I'm training to become a web developer because I am full of ideas for websites and mobile apps that I want to turn into a reality.</p>

        <p>In 2007, I taught myself how to use iMovie and created my first video, <i>A Tribute to Women in Film</i>, which I scored with Bob Dylan's <i>Lay Lady Lay</i>.  <br><br>While satisifed with my first production, I later saw things I wanted to change.  At the same time, I started experimenting more and more with iMovie's features and adapted a style of editing that was in sync with the rhythm of the music. With each successive video I created, I used a new feature and tightened how I used cuts and transitions.  <br><br>In 2009, I was hired for my first professional job.  Whether I create a professional video for a client or a personal video of my own ideas, I find the process a labor of love and take great satisfaction when I see the final product!</p>
